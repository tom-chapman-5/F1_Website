				<h2 style="text-align:center;">The History of Racing Bulls</h2>
				<p style="text-align: center;">Racing Bull, originally Toro Rosso, was established as Red Bull's junior team despite them winning a race before the main team.</p>

					<h2>Toro Rosso</h2>
					<p>Racing Bulls, originally known as Toro Rosso, was established in 2006 as a sister team to Red Bull Racing. The team's primary objective was to provide a platform for young drivers from Red Bull's driver development program to gain experience in Formula 1. In 2008, Toro Rosso achieved a significant milestone by securing its first and only Formula 1 victory at the Italian Grand Prix, with driver Sebastian Vettel clinching the win.</p>

					<h2>AlphaTauri</h2>
					<p>In 2020, Toro Rosso underwent a rebranding and became known as AlphaTauri, aligning with Red Bull's fashion brand of the same name. The rebranding aimed to create a stronger connection between the team's identity and Red Bull's lifestyle ventures. During this period, AlphaTauri continued to serve as a proving ground for emerging talent, with notable performances including Pierre Gasly's remarkable victory at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix.</p>

					<h2>Racing Bulls</h2>
					<p>In 2024, the team was rebranded once again, this time as Racing Bulls, reflecting its Italian company name, Racing Bulls S.p.A. This change was part of a strategic move to simplify the team's identity and appeal to a younger audience. The official name became Visa Cash App Racing Bulls F1 Team, incorporating the team's title sponsors. The 2025 season saw the team adopt a new livery, featuring a predominantly white color scheme with prominent Red Bull branding, signaling a closer alignment with its parent company.</p>
